 * Onboarding declaration point for THIS project (the template ships none —
 * see packages/onboarding/README.md and the `product-screen` skill).
 *
 * Fill ONBOARDING_STEPS with the few steps that take a brand-new user to
 * their first real result. Everything degrades gracefully while it is
 * empty: post-auth lands on the app root and no checklist is rendered.
 *
 * Prefer LIVE step predicates over click-tracking: give a step a `done`
 * derived from real product state (e.g. "has connected a data source") so
 * the checklist reflects reality, not just clicks. `completeStep` remains
 * for steps that have no observable signal.
 *
 * Example:
 *   export const ONBOARDING_STEPS: OnboardingStep[] = [
 *     { key: "connect-source", title: "Connect your data source", href: "/settings/connections", done: hasConnection },
 *     { key: "first-report", title: "Open your first report", href: "/reports" },
 *   ];
